    <h3>NAME</h3>
      <p>&emsp;rmdir - delete a directory</p>

    <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
      <p>&emsp;<b>#include <unistd.h></b> <b>nt</b> <i>rmdir(const</i> <b>char</b> <i>*"</i> <b>pathname</b> <i>);</i> </p>

    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <p>&emsp;<b>rmdir</b> ()  deletes a directory, which must be empty.</p>

    <h3>RETURN VALUE</h3>
      <p>&emsp;On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.</p>

    <h3>ERRORS</h3>
      <p>&emsp;<b>EACCES</b></p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;Write access to the directory containing <i>pathname</i> was not allowed, or one of the directories in the path prefix of <i>pathname</i> did not allow search permission.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;(See also <b>path_resolution</b> (7). </p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EBUSY</b> <i>pathname</i> is currently in use by the system or some process that prevents its removal. On Linux this means <i>pathname</i> is currently used as a mount point</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;or is the root directory of the calling process.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EFAULT</b> <i>pathname</i> points <i>outside</i> your <i>accessible</i> address <i>space."</i> </p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EINVAL</b> <i>pathname</i> has <i>.</i> as last component.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ELOOP</b> Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving <i>pathname</i> . </p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ENAMETOOLONG</b> <i>pathname</i> was <i>too</i> long." </p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ENOENT</b> A directory component in <i>pathname</i> does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ENOTDIR</b> <i>pathname</i> ,  or a component used as a directory in <i>pathname</i> ,  is not, in fact, a directory.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>ENOTEMPTY</b> <i>pathname</i> contains entries other than <i>.</i> and <i>..</i> ;"  or, <i>pathname</i> has <i>..</i> as its final component. POSIX.1-2001 also allows</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EEXIST</b> for this condition.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EPERM</b> The directory containing <i>pathname</i> has the sticky bit ( <b>S_ISVTX</b> )  set and the process's effective user ID is neither the user ID</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;of the file to be deleted nor that of the directory containing it, and the process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the <b>CAP_FOWNER</b> capability).</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EPERM</b> The filesystem containing <i>pathname</i> does not support the removal of directories.</p>

      <p>&emsp;&emsp;<b>EROFS</b> <i>pathname</i> refers to a directory on a read-only filesystem.</p>

    <h3>CONFORMING TO</h3>
      <p>&emsp;SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

    <h3>BUGS</h3>
      <p>&emsp;Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can cause the unexpected disappearance of directories which are still being used.</p>
